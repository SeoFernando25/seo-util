## What is SeoUtil
SeoUtil is python library made with the sole purpose of having a highly readable implementation of general purpose programming functions.
Maybe it's personal, maybe it's public, I just wanted to have a place I can go whenever I forget how to do some basic stuff.

## What this library is for

- Provides examples of small usefully functions for general purpose projects
- See highly readable (and more than always not optimal) implementations of diverse algorithms

## "You should have or add this"

Yeah I'm working on it... feel free to add anything you like ðŸ™‚
